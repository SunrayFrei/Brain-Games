# Brain Games

:white_check_mark: There are five games: brain-even, brain-calc, brain-gcd, brain-prime and brain-progression.

- **_Brain-even_**
  The game has three rounds. A random number is offered to the player. He should determine whether it is even. And answer "yes" or "no" accordingly. If the player answers correctly three times, he wins.
- **_Brain-calc_**
  The game has three rounds. A player is offered a random action with two random numbers: addition, subtraction, multiplication or division. He should to write the result of this action. If the player answers correctly three times, he wins.

- **_Brain-gcd_**
  The game has three rounds. The player is asked to determine the greatest common divisor for two proposed numbers. If the player answers correctly three times, he wins.
- **_Brain-prime_**
  The game has three rounds. The player is asked to determine whether a number is prime (that is, divisible without remainder only by 1 and itself). If the player answers correctly three times, he wins.
- **_Brain-progression_**
  The game has three rounds. The player should to identify the missing number in the progression. If the player answers correctly three times, he wins.
